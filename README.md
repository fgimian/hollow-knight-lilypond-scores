# Hollow Knight Lilypond Scores

This repository will contain piano scores for various Hollow Knight pieces written using the free[Lilypond](https://lilypond.org/) notation software.  You may easily open and render these scores using [Frescobaldi](https://frescobaldi.org/).

The reasons I decided to create my own transcriptions of the scores are as follows:

* The [official sheet music](https://themateriastore.com/products/hollow-knight-piano-collections-digital-sheet-music) varies signifciantly from the original music.
* The transcriptions by Stoh are the closest we have but also vary a little from the original score.
* No transcriptions have suggested fingering.

My intention is to have these scores sound identical to the piano parts of the original music with no variation at all.  Furthermore, it is a great opportunity for me to learn Lilypond.
